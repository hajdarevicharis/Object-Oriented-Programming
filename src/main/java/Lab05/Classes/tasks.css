/*
1. Create a simple logging system that allows different components of a system to log messages.
 Implement this system using both traditional class-based and record-based approaches.
 Use lambda functions to define the logging behavior.

Create an interface called Logger with a single method logMessage(String message)
Implement a record named RecordLogger that implements the Logger interface.
Implement the logMessage method to print the log message with the logger name.
Implement a class named ClassLogger that also implements the Logger interface.
The class should have a constructor that takes a String representing the logger name.
Implement the logMessage method to print the log message with the logger name.
In the main method, Instantiate both the RecordLogger and ClassLogger with different names.
Use lambda functions to log messages with each logger.
